# Gemini CLI Project Configuration

## Development Principles

### Architecture Guidelines
- Apply clean architecture patterns
- Separate concerns appropriately
- Use dependency injection where beneficial
- Design for testability and maintainability

### Code Standards
- Follow language-specific best practices
